# seans_portfolio

This is a project I have been working on to restyle and create a custom portfolio website for my brother, who is a graphic designer. It is mostly HTML/CSS, but I am planning on adding more JS features with animations.

To do:
- make image file sizes smaller and uniform
- consolidate css styles into shorthand where applicable
- add :focus to contact form
- add animation to make home image of sean disappear when user scrolls up
- add image carousels to work pages
